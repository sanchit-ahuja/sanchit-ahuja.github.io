## [Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence]{:target="_blank"}, Research Fellow
Advisors: [Dr. Makarand Tapaswi]{:target="_blank"}, [Dr. Rahul Panicker]{:target="_blank"}, [Dr. P. Anandan]{:target="_blank"}

Research
- Developed prototypes for pregnancy risk stratification using socio-economic time-series data
- Helped build the first version of a synthetic data generation framework to generate synthetic data (via Blender) for the Anthropometry project (Estimation of weight from Video). It has since grown to be a separate system in itself.
- Built and evaluated existing 3D reconstruction algorithms for our use case

Engineering
- Built pipelines for data validation, automated processing, annotation and preprocessing. Basically, everything post data collection till processed data ready to be used by our models.

Others
- Gave invited talks about my work at Max Planck Institute of Intelligent Systems, Tuebingen and BITS Pilani
- Helped strategise the initial data collection effort (from a research standpoint). We have currently collected video data from 6k babies spanning 6 states in India.
- Developed processes for coordination across Products, Programs, Engineering and Research for data collection
- Proposed best practices for deep learning projects in the form of a guidelines document that was adopted as de-facto standard across the organisation.
- Mentored 4 research interns spanning 2 summers and multiple other research fellows across teams.

## [Machine and Language Learning Lab, IISc]{:target="_blank"}, Research Assitant
Advisor - [Dr. Partha Talukdar]{:target="_blank"}

- Developed a knowledge graph (KG) based Positive Unlabeled (PU) classifier (KG-PU classifier) to create a domain specific corpus from the web given a seed set.
- Beat OCSVM, PUSVM, SVM (treating all non class data as negative data) algorithms (as measured by F1 score) on [NYT dataset]{:target="_blank"} and real data in the scarce data regime of 50 - 500 documents.
- Built a fully distributed crawler in the process with capacity to crawl over 100k documents in a week. Plugged the above developed classifier into the crawler to filter documents during the crawl

## [Apache Software Foundation]{:target="_blank"}, Google Summer of Code '17
Advisor - Mr. Trevor Grant

- Contributed the DBSCAN algorithm to the clustering submodule in Apache Mahout

## [Boomerang Commerce]{:target="_blank"}, Software Engineering Intern
Advisor - Mr. Satish Thakur

- Built an automated employee account management platform to manage all employee accounts
- Built a dashboard to create, update, delete and manage employee accounts and respective access permissions
- Wrote unit tests and pushed the platform to production

## [Machine Vision Lab]{:target="_blank"}, Research Intern
Advisor - Dr. Jagdish Lal Raheja
- Developed a system to collect real time data from sensors, camera and Kinect as part of developing an activity recognition system
- Continued the internship as a course project and developed classifier to classify activities in real time
