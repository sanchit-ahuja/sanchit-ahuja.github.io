## [Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence]{:target="_blank"}, Research Fellow
Advisors: Dr. Rahul Panicker, Dr. P. Anandan


## [Machine and Language Learning Lab, IISc]{:target="_blank"}, Research Assitant
Advisor - Dr. Partha Talukdar

- Developed a knowledge graph (KG) based Positive Unlabeled (PU) classifier (KG-PU classifier) to create a domain specific corpus from the web given a seed set.
- Beat OCSVM, PUSVM, SVM (treating all non class data as negative data) algorithms (as measured by F1 score) on [NYT dataset]{:target="_blank"} and real data in the scarce data regime of 50 - 500 documents.
- Built a fully distributed crawler in the process with capacity to crawl over 100k documents in a week. Plugged the above developed classifier into the crawler to filter documents during the crawl

## [Apache Software Foundation]{:target="_blank"}, Google Summer of Code '17
Advisor - Mr. Trevor Grant

- Contributed the DBSCAN algorithm to the clustering submodule in Apache Mahout

## [Boomerang Commerce]{:target="_blank"}, Software Engineering Intern
Advisor - Mr. Satish Thakur

- Built an automated employee account management platform to manage all employee accounts
- Built a dashboard to create, update, delete and manage employee accounts and respective access permissions
- Wrote unit tests and pushed the platform to production

## [Machine Vision Lab]{:target="_blank"}, Research Intern
Advisor - Dr. Jagdish Lal Raheja
- Developed a system to collect real time data from sensors, camera and Kinect as part of developing an activity recognition system
- Continued the internship as a course project and developed classifier to classify activities in real time
