## [Fi]{:target="_blank"}, Data Science Intern
<!-- Advisors: [Dr. Makarand Tapaswi]{:target="_blank"}, [Dr. Rahul Panicker]{:target="_blank"}, [Dr. P. Anandan]{:target="_blank"} -->
Mentor: [Ishita Mathur]{:target="_blank"}
- Implemented **Hierarchical Classification** as a solution to the problem of **Transaction Categorisation** by using pre-trained **BERT** embeddings as feature vectors for the transaction remarks, and a **Logit pipeline** to classify the transactions into different bins hierarchically.
- Preprocessed, cleaned and labelled the production data by writing automating scripts.

## [Language Technology Lab, Universität Hamburg, Germany]{:target="_blank"}, Research Intern
Advisor - [Dr. Chris Biemann]{:target="_blank"}
- Worked on the problem of applying **Reinforcement Learning** on **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**
- Built upon the work of Tsz Kin Lam et al. on [Reinforcement Learning Approach to Interactive Prediction Translation]
- Majorly focused on using latin and non-latin language pair datasets such as **Eng-Viet** for our experiments.
- Experimented with different reward functions such as **BLEU, YiSi, CharF** by analyzing reward scores and translation quality to figure out which would work the best under given conditions for the problem of RL on Interactive Prediction Translation.


## [Clear]{:target="_blank"}, Software Engineering Intern
Advisor - [Shashank Singh]{:target="_blank"}
- Worked on the **GST (Indirect Tax System of India)** software which helps SMEs, Chartered Accountants and Enterprises to file GST returns and simplifies their filing experience
- Built new features for the GST product using frameworks and libraries like **NextJS, GraphQL, React, Apollo (Client), Jest**


## Samsung, Computer Vision Intern
Advisor - [Sevanand Singh]{:target="_blank"}
- Optimized neural network architectures for **Single Image Super Resolution (SISR)** to upscale images from low resolution to high resolution by a factor of 2x or 4x.
- Implemented the paper **Wide Activation for Efficient and Accurate Image Super-Resolution (WDSR)**
- Achieved SoTA results on Div2K data. Clocked a **PSNR** of **30** on validation set using **Python and TensorFlow 2.0**
