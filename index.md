Hi! I'm Aditya. I'm currently a Research Fellow at the [Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://wadhwaniai.org){:target="_blank"}, a independent, nonprofit research institute and global hub, developing AI solutions for social good. I am one of the founding members of the visual weighing machine team where we're developing state of the art deep learning techniques to help identify the 10 million low birth weight babies missed by the health system each year around the globe. At Wadhwani AI, with research as my core expertise, I also dabble in engineering (built our data ingestion and annotation pipelines) and as an overall lead on different substreams of our project (data, annotation, modelling)

My industry experience has enabled me to acquire the following skills
1. Applied AI research (Problem identification, formulation and execution majorly in 3D Computer Vision and Deep Learning)
2. Software Development (Building data and annotation pipelines, frameworks to train deep networks with ease)
3. Leadership skills (I was the lead our data collection, processing and annotation efforts from research involving engineers, research scientists and product managers). Received professional leadership training to augment my leadership toolkit in the process.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Machine and Language Learning (MALL) Lab](http://malllabiisc.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, IISc Bangalore where I worked on positive unlabeled classification algorithms to fetch documents from the web that resemble a seed set (often very small, 500 documents). I helped build a distributed crawler, a PU classifier and relation extraction algorithms to construct domain specific knowledge graphs from a web corpus. A system similar to [NELL](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/){:target="_blank"} but restricted to a specific domain.


I graduated with Honours. in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} where I worked with [Dr. Poonam Goyal](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/poonam/profile){:target="_blank"} at the [Advanced Data Analytics and Parallel Technologies (ADAPT) Lab](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/){:target="_blank"} on building large scale distributed algorithms for clustering (1 billion data points in 41 minutes using a mere 32 nodes) - The work I did for my undergraduate thesis has been accepted as a full research paper in the Algorithms track of the IEEE Cluster Computing Conference. As a follow up, I contributed to [Apache Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} as part of the Google Summer of Code '17 where I worked on the design and implementation of distributed [DBSCAN](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf){:target="_blank"}
