Hi! I'm Aditya. I'm currently a Research Fellow at the [Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence]{:target="_blank"}, a independent, nonprofit research institute and global hub, developing AI solutions for social good. We're building a video based anthropometry tool using parametric neonate models to effectively catch many of the millions of low birth weight babies that are missed each year. 

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Computer  Vision

Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Machine and Language Learning (MALL) Lab]{:target="_blank"}, IISc Bangalore where I worked on positive unlabeled classification algorithms to fetch documents from the web that resemble a seed set (often very small, 500 documents). I helped build a distributed crawler, a PU classifier and relation extraction algorithms to construct domain specific knowledge graphs from a web corpus. A system similar to [NELL]{:target="_blank"} but restricted to a specific domain

I contributed to [Apache Mahout]{:target="_blank"} as part of the Google Summer of Code '17 where I worked on the design and implementation of distributed [DBSCAN]{:target="_blank"}

I graduated with Honours. in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani]{:target="_blank"} where I worked with [Dr. Poonam Goyal]{:target="_blank"} at the [Advanced Data Analytics and Parallel Technologies (ADAPT) Lab]{:target="_blank"} on building large scale distributed algorithms for clustering (1 billion data points in 41 minutes using a mere 32 nodes) - The work I did for my undergraduate thesis has been accepted as a full research paper in the Algorithms track of the IEEE Cluster Computing Conference

I also worked with [Dr. Jagdish Raheja]{:target="_blank"} at the Machine Vision Lab in CSIR-CEERI, Pilani on fall detection in elderly people and [Dr. Lavika Goel]{:target="_blank"} at the [Multimedia and HCI Lab]{:target="_blank"} on nature inspired swarm optimization algorithms.
