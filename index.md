Hi! I'm Aditya. I'm currently a Research Fellow at the [Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence]{:target="_blank"}, a independent, nonprofit research institute and global hub, developing AI solutions for social good. I am one of the founding members of the video based anthropometry tool where we're developing state of the art 3D reconstruction techniques to help identify the 10 million low birth weight babies missed by the health system each year around the globe.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and it's applications to widespread problems.
By virtue of my 3 year industry experience, I have developed a wide range of skills to support my research in large scale ML including 3D vision, system design, natural language processing, distributed computing, software engineering, leading and mentoring research projects.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Machine and Language Learning (MALL) Lab]{:target="_blank"}, IISc Bangalore where I worked on positive unlabeled classification algorithms to fetch documents from the web that resemble a seed set (often very small, 500 documents). I helped build a distributed crawler, a PU classifier and relation extraction algorithms to construct domain specific knowledge graphs from a web corpus. A system similar to [NELL]{:target="_blank"} but restricted to a specific domain

I graduated with Honours. in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani]{:target="_blank"} where I worked with [Dr. Poonam Goyal]{:target="_blank"} at the [Advanced Data Analytics and Parallel Technologies (ADAPT) Lab]{:target="_blank"} on building large scale distributed algorithms for clustering (1 billion data points in 41 minutes using a mere 32 nodes) - The work I did for my undergraduate thesis has been accepted as a full research paper in the Algorithms track of the IEEE Cluster Computing Conference. As a follow up, I contributed to [Apache Mahout]{:target="_blank"} as part of the Google Summer of Code '17 where I worked on the design and implementation of distributed [DBSCAN]{:target="_blank"}
