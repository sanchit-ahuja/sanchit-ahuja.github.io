## Parallel Clustering Algorithms for Big Data
---
Advisor: [Dr. Poonam Goyal]{:target="_blank"}
* As part of my undergraduate thesis, Designed and developed a parallel spatial clustering algorithm that scales to a billion data points. Benchmarked the algorithm on various million/billion sized datasets and achieved 100x speedup
* You can find the thesis [here](https://adityaas.github.io/documents/Undergraduate_Thesis.pdf)
* Our paper "[`\mu`DBSCAN: An Exact Scalable DBSCAN Algorithm for Big Data Exploiting Spatial Locality](https://adityaas.github.io/documents/MuDBSCAN_CLUSTER19.pdf)" has been accepted as a full research paper at [IEEE Cluster 2019](https://clustercomp.org/2019/) in the Algorithms Track.

## Speeding up Image Segmentation Algorithms - [Github](https://github.com/AdityaAS/FoodSense)
---
Advisor: [Dr. Lavika Goel]{:target="_blank"}
* Developed a hybrid optimization algorithm and applied the algorithm to make image segmentation efficient
* Our paper "[Hybridization of Moth Flame Optimization and Gravitational Search Algorithm and its Application to detection of Food Quality](https://adityaas.github.io/documents/Intellisys.pdf)" was accepted at the Intelligent Systems Conference (Intellisys) 2017, held in London, UK

## Activity Recognition using Cameras, Sensors and Kinect
---
Advisor: [Dr. Jagdish Raheja]{:target="_blank"}
* Developed vision based models for Activity Recognition identifying 6 basic activities (Standing, Sitting, Walking, Lying, Bending, Falling) with emphasis on Fall
* Report can be found [here](https://adityaas.github.io/documents/EndTermReport.pdf)
